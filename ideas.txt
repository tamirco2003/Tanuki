scanner struct, "state machine" (state + buffer).

keywords:
trie
actual perfect hashing (http://ilan.schnell-web.net/prog/perfect-hash/algo.html)
fake perfect hashing (minimal(?) hashing function that is different for every keyword and can collide (even often) when inserting other strings.
                      hash and strcmp on collision, saves comparing with every keyword)
